# Agents and Campaigns Code Challenge

This is a code challenge dealing with a sample DB in [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) dealing with Agents and Campaigns. Using a provided [SQLite database](./database/shyftoff.db), the build will be for a simple web-based application that fulfills following user stories:

1. As a ShyftOff admin user, I need to manage the agentsâ€™ properties and campaign
assignments in a single UI.
2. As a ShyftOff customer user, I want to see my campaign and dashboard of KPIs:
    1. Hours worked, grouped by day, week, and month.

UI should feature responsive design. Bonus for animation or gamification elements incorporated
into the customer dashboard.
